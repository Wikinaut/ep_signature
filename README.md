ep_signature
============

What is it?
-----------
A plugin for Etherpad Lite that allows for simple insertion of a signature that contains the date and username.

Where is it?
------------
I have it revisioned on GitHub @itguy51/ep_signature and I publish it to npm every week if it has been updated within that week (See Update Policy at the bottom)

Why Make it?
------------
I saw the idea on the Etherpad Lite plugin wishlist, and realized it would be usable in my case, so I decided to contribute.
